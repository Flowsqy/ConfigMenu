# File where commands are registered
#
#
# Schema:
#
#<command_name>:
#  inventory: <inventory-path>
#  aliases:
#    - [alias-1]
#    - [alias-2]
#    - ...
#  permission: [permission]
#  permission-message: [permission-message]
#
#
# [] -> Optional
# <> -> Required
#
# Where :
# <command-name> is a valid command name
# <inventory-path> is a valid inventory path (see below)
# [alias-1] [alias-2] ... are all the aliases for the command (remove aliases section to set no aliases)
# [permission] is the permission of the command (remove permission section to set no permission)
# [permission-message] is the message that is shown when an user process the command without permission
#   (Only set if there is a permission set, remove permission-message section to keep he default one)
#
#
#
# An inventory path has two valid patterns:
# 1. <inventory-id>
#   The plugin will search for an inventory section with the id <inventory-id> in the current file
# 2. <file-path>:<inventory-id>
#   The plugin will search for an inventory section with the id <inventory-id> in the file <file-path>, relative to the plugin's folder
#
# Examples:
#
# main-inventory:
#   -> plugin will search for the section 'main-inventory' in the file commands.yml (because it's the current file)
#
# inventories/second_inventory.yml:inventory
#   -> plugin will search for the section 'inventory' in the file plugins/ConfigMenu/inventories/second_inventory.yml
